# Agent profiles for MCP-centric runs
# Each profile defines: name, role prompt, allowed MCP servers (or * for all), and model preference.

agent_profiles:
  default:
    name: Default
    description: General-purpose goal execution using available MCP tools and legacy agents
    role_prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant that plans steps to achieve the user's goal.
      You can use the available MCP tools. Output exactly one next action: either
      a tool call (tool name + arguments as JSON) or FINISH with a final answer.
    allowed_mcp_servers: []  # empty = use legacy orchestrator agents only; add server ids when MCP enabled
    model: null  # use app default LLM
    enabled: true

  # Profile that can use Playwright for browser automation (navigate, click, fill, screenshot, etc.)
  browser:
    name: Browser / Web Automation
    description: "Use Playwright to automate the browser: navigate, click, fill forms, extract content, take screenshots"
    role_prompt: |
      You are a web automation assistant. You have access to Playwright MCP tools to control a browser.
      Use them to navigate to URLs, click elements, fill forms, read page content, or take screenshots as needed.
      Plan one step at a time. Output exactly one JSON object: either a tool call (action "tool_call" with
      server_id "playwright", tool_name and arguments) or FINISH with the final answer for the user.
    allowed_mcp_servers: [playwright]
    model: null
    enabled: true

  # Deep research: fetch URLs + browser automation (no memory server yet)
  deep_research:
    name: Deep Research
    description: Multi-step research using Fetch (HTTP) and Playwright (browser); gather info and synthesize answers
    role_prompt: |
      You are a research agent. Use Fetch to get web page content as markdown, and Playwright when you need to
      interact with pages (click, fill forms, navigate). Plan one step at a time. Prefer fetch for simple URL
      content; use Playwright when the user needs interaction or JavaScript-rendered content.
      Output exactly one JSON object: either action "tool_call" (server_id "fetch" or "playwright", tool_name, arguments)
      or action "finish" with "answer" containing the final synthesized answer for the user.
    allowed_mcp_servers: [fetch, playwright]
    model: null
    enabled: true
