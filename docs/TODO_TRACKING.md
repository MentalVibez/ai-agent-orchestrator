# TODO tracking

In-code TODOs that are good candidates for GitHub issues. Create an issue for each and link from the code if you want to track them.

| Location | TODO summary |
|----------|----------------|
| `app/llm/openai.py` | Implement OpenAI text generation, streaming, generation with metadata |
| `app/llm/ollama.py` | Implement Ollama text generation, streaming, generation with metadata |
| `app/core/orchestrator.py` | Implement workflow execution logic |
| `app/core/messaging.py` | Implement message subscription, publishing, history retrieval |
| `app/agents/log_analysis.py` | Implement log analysis execution |
| `app/agents/infrastructure.py` | Implement infrastructure execution |

No action required for TODOs that are intentional (e.g. code review agent’s “TODO|FIXME” pattern match).
