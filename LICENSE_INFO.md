# License Information

## Current License: Apache License 2.0

This project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**, an enterprise-friendly open-source licence that provides explicit patent protection alongside standard permissive terms.

## Why Apache 2.0?

Apache 2.0 was chosen because:

1. **Patent Grant**: Explicitly grants users a royalty-free patent licence from all contributors — protects users and the community from patent claims
2. **Enterprise-Friendly**: Widely adopted by enterprise open-source projects; accepted by legal teams across industry
3. **Commercial Use**: Allows full commercial use, modification, and redistribution
4. **Competitive Safety**: Appropriate for open-source alternatives to commercial software — contributors cannot later assert patents against users
5. **Compatible**: Compatible with GPL v3, LGPL, MIT, and most other open-source licences

## What You Can Do

✅ **Commercial Use** — Use in commercial products and services
✅ **Modify** — Change the code to fit your needs
✅ **Distribute** — Share original or modified versions
✅ **Private Use** — Use in proprietary/closed-source projects
✅ **Patent Use** — Contributors grant you a royalty-free patent licence

## What You Must Do

⚠️ **Include Licence** — Keep the Apache 2.0 licence file and copyright notice in all distributions
⚠️ **State Changes** — If you modify files, add a notice stating you changed them
⚠️ **Attribution** — Retain all existing copyright, patent, and attribution notices

## What You Cannot Do

❌ **Use Trademarks** — Cannot use the project's name/logo to endorse your derivative products without permission
❌ **Hold Liable** — Contributors are not liable for any damages

## Comparison with MIT (Previous Licence)

| Feature | MIT | Apache 2.0 |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| Commercial use | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modification | ✅ | ✅ |
| Distribution | ✅ | ✅ |
| Patent grant | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trademark clause | ❌ | ✅ |
| State changes required | ❌ | ✅ |

The key improvement over MIT is the **explicit patent grant**, which is important when building software that may compete with or replicate functionality of commercial products.
